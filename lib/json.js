//TODO: decide how to implement JSON functions, if we are to implement them

// One possible solution is to assume it is always available in non-browser environments, and augment IE < 9 with
// Base2. Pro: all platforms would allow to use JSON as specified by the standards.

// Another possible solution is to provide a default implementation as in Dojo 1.x, which delegates to native
// JSON functions and replace this module with real implementations for legacy platforms.

// For now it is skipped.
